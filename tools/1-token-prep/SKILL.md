name: figma-token-update-plan
description: Creates a structured plan for updating Figma variables based on component-tokens.csv as the source of truth. Use when preparing to sync Figma variables with a component token CSV, before running a Figma MCP update skill. Produces a human-reviewable plan covering value updates, renames, deletions, and additions.
---
Read the input files from this workspace (paths relative to workspace root):
  - inputs/inputs.json (componentName)
  - inputs/component-tokens.csv (source of truth for all tasks)
  - inputs/figma-variables.json
  - tools/knowledge/figma-base-variables.csv (base token name → variable ID lookup)

**Before running any tasks**, sync `tools/knowledge/figma-base-variables.csv` against the live DS Base Library using Figma MCP (see "Sync base variable lookup" section below).

After completing all tasks, determine a suggested branch name for the `build-figma-variables` skill using these rules (applied to the plan summary counts):

| Plan content | Branch name pattern |
|---|---|
| Additions > 0, Deletes = 0, Renames = 0, Value updates = 0 | `[componentName]: Add` |
| Deletes > 0, Additions = 0, Renames = 0, Value updates = 0 | `[componentName]: Remove` |
| Any other combination | `[componentName]: Update - [brief description ≤ 5 words summarising the dominant change]` |

Use `componentName` from `inputs/inputs.json` as `[componentName]`. Include the suggested branch name in the output file header (see Output section).

# Figma Token Update Plan

You are generating a plan to bring Figma variables in sync with a component token CSV. **Do not make any Figma changes.** Output a human-readable plan file only, for review before any updates are applied.

---

## Inputs

- **Review config:** `inputs/inputs.json`
  `componentName`: the name of the component being updated (e.g. `"button"`). Use this to filter Figma variables and to name the output file.

- **Component tokens (source of truth):** `inputs/component-tokens.csv`
  CSV with a token name column (first column, or named `name` / `Full Token`) and value columns: `All Modes`, `Light Mode`, `Dark Mode`. Every non-empty row after the header is a token and is in scope — treat the CSV as the complete and authoritative token list.

- **Figma variables:** `inputs/figma-variables.json`
  JSON array of variable objects. Each has: `id`, `name`, `collection`, `resolvedType`, `valuesByMode`, `hiddenFromPublishing`, `scopes`. The `valuesByMode` map uses Figma mode IDs as keys; use the mode names in context (e.g. "All Modes", "Light", "Dark") to align with the CSV columns when comparing values.

- **Base variable lookup:** `tools/knowledge/figma-base-variables.csv`
  CSV with columns `name`, `value`, `id`. Maps every base token name (using `/` delimiters, e.g. `base/color/red/500`) to its Figma variable ID. Use this to resolve the variable ID for any required value when planning updates or additions.

---

## Component scoping — Figma variables

Only consider Figma variables whose **component segment** (the second `/`-delimited path segment, e.g. `top_nav_bar` in `color/top_nav_bar/bg`) exactly matches `componentName`. Variables where the component name appears only in a deeper segment belong to other components and must be excluded entirely from all tasks.

---

## Name normalization

The CSV and Figma use different naming conventions. Before any comparison, normalize CSV token names into Figma format using these two rules applied in order:

1. **Strip the `affirm.` namespace prefix** — remove the leading `affirm.` from the CSV name.
2. **Convert delimiter** — replace all remaining `.` separators with `/`.

**Example:** `affirm.color.top_nav_bar.main.container.bg` → `color/top_nav_bar/main/container/bg`

Use the normalized form only for matching. Always display original names (CSV format and Figma format) in the output.

---

## Base token value lookup

CSV token values reference base tokens using dot notation (e.g. `base.color.red.500`). To resolve a variable ID for any required value in a planned UPDATE or ADD:

1. Normalize the CSV value the same way as token names: replace `.` with `/` (no prefix to strip — base token values have no `affirm.` prefix).
   **Example:** `base.color.red.500` → `base/color/red/500`
2. Look up the normalized value in `tools/knowledge/figma-base-variables.csv` by matching the `name` column.
3. Use the `id` column value as the variable ID for that value.

If a value cannot be found in the lookup CSV (e.g. it is a raw primitive like `#FFFFFF` rather than an alias), note it as "no alias found" and include the raw value instead.

Always include the resolved variable ID alongside every required value in UPDATE and ADD plans.

---

## Sync base variable lookup

Run this before any tasks. Use Figma MCP to fetch all local variables from the DS Base Library and update `tools/knowledge/figma-base-variables.csv` to match.

**DS Base Library:**
- File key: `Sj1A24j9ANkav6SG2pHbop`
- URL: `https://www.figma.com/design/Sj1A24j9ANkav6SG2pHbop/%F0%9F%8E%A8--R--DS-Base-Library?node-id=4718-7648&t=8gY2lycibW7oZ1wz-11`

Call `get_variable_defs(fileKey)` to retrieve all variables. The CSV has columns `name`, `value`, `id`. For each variable returned by Figma MCP:

- **name**: the variable's path name using `/` delimiters (e.g. `base/color/red/500`)
- **value**: the resolved primitive value or alias name
- **id**: the Figma variable ID (e.g. `VariableID:4360:1126027`)

Compare the full set of variables from Figma against every row in the CSV and apply these changes directly to `tools/knowledge/figma-base-variables.csv`:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Variable exists in Figma but not in CSV | **Add** a new row |
| Variable exists in CSV but not in Figma | **Delete** the row |
| Variable exists in both but `id` or `value` differs | **Update** the row |
| Variable exists in both and all columns match | No change |

**Fully overwrite** `tools/knowledge/figma-base-variables.csv` with the updated content. Use the updated CSV for all base token lookups in the tasks below.

If the Figma MCP server is not available, skip this sync step, use the existing CSV as-is, and note in the output that the base variable lookup was not validated against the live library.

---

## Tasks

Work through the tasks in order. **Every token and every Figma variable must appear in exactly one task** — once placed, it must not appear as a candidate in any later task, regardless of confidence level.

### Task 1 — Normalized exact matches: identify value updates

Normalize every CSV token name using the rules above. Find all pairs where the normalized CSV name exactly matches an in-scope Figma variable name (case-sensitive, whitespace-trimmed).

A normalized exact match means the segment content is identical — the only differences are the `affirm.` prefix and `.` vs `/` delimiters, which are convention differences and **do not require a rename in Figma**.

For each normalized exact match:
- Compare the `All Modes`, `Light Mode`, and `Dark Mode` values from the CSV against the corresponding mode values in `valuesByMode`. Plan an **UPDATE** for any mode where the values differ.
- If all values already match, mark the token as **in sync** — include in Task 5.

### Task 2 — Potential matches: identify renames and value updates

For CSV tokens **not** resolved in Task 1, and for in-scope Figma variables **not** resolved in Task 1, look for likely pairs based on name similarity. Treat a pair as a potential match when the normalized CSV name and the Figma name:
- Share all or nearly all path segments in the same order with only minor differences (e.g. an extra segment in one, a segment renamed or abbreviated)
- Are plausibly the same token despite structural differences not covered by normalization

For each potential match:
- Note the CSV token name and the Figma variable name + id
- Compare `All Modes`, `Light Mode`, and `Dark Mode` values
- If the normalized CSV name and the Figma name differ in segment content (not just convention), plan a **RENAME** of the Figma variable to match the normalized CSV name (using Figma's `/` delimiter, without the `affirm.` prefix)
- Plan an **UPDATE** for any mode value discrepancies
- Assign a confidence level (High / Medium / Low) with a one-line rationale

**Every token paired here — regardless of confidence level — is consumed by Task 2 and must not appear in Task 3 or Task 4.** Low-confidence pairs are flagged for the user to review and adjust in the plan before the build step runs.

### Task 3 — Deletes

In-scope Figma variables that were **not** matched in Task 1 or Task 2 have no corresponding token in the CSV and should be removed from Figma.

For each, plan a **DELETE** and list the variable name and id.

### Task 4 — Additions

CSV tokens that were **not** matched in Task 1 or Task 2 do not yet exist in Figma and need to be created.

For each, plan an **ADD** and include:
- The token name and the values from the CSV (`All Modes`, `Light Mode`, `Dark Mode`). For each non-empty value, resolve the corresponding variable ID using the base token value lookup rules above (normalize the value, match against `tools/knowledge/figma-base-variables.csv`, use the `id` column). If no match is found, note "no alias found" and include the raw value.
- **Scopes**: Determine the correct Figma variable scopes by matching the normalized token name against the rules in `tools/knowledge/figma-variable-scoping-rules.md`. Apply the first matching rule. List all required scope values (e.g. `["TEXT_FILL"]`, `["FRAME_FILL","SHAPE_FILL"]`).
- **Hidden from publishing**: Determine the correct `hiddenFromPublishing` value (`true` or `false`) from the same matching rule in `tools/knowledge/figma-variable-scoping-rules.md`.

## Output

Read `componentName` from `inputs/inputs.json`. Turn it into a safe filename segment (lowercase, spaces and slashes → hyphens; use `component` as fallback if missing). Use today's date and time: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM`.

Write the plan to **two locations** with identical content:
1. `outputs/1-token-prep/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-{componentName}-token-update-plan.md` — dated record
2. `inputs/build-figma-variables-plan.md` — working plan for the next skill (**fully overwrite**)

Use the structure below. If a section has no items, write "None." so reviewers can confirm the check ran cleanly.
