name: build-figma-variables
description: Creates a Figma library branch and implements variable changes from a build plan using Figma MCP. Use when building or updating Figma variables in the library based on a prepared plan document, before a designer works on a component. Reads inputs/inputs.json for the library URL and inputs/build-figma-variables-plan.md for the changes to apply.
---

Read these input files (paths relative to workspace root):
- `inputs/inputs.json` — `libraryUrl` (Figma library file URL) and `componentName`
- `inputs/build-figma-variables-plan.md` — Variable changes to implement (adds, updates, renames, deletes)

---

# Build Figma Variables

You are implementing variable changes in a Figma library branch using the Figma MCP server. This runs **before** a designer works on the component.

---

## Step 1 — Read inputs

Read `inputs/inputs.json`:
- `componentName` — used to name the branch and output file
- `libraryUrl` — Figma library URL. Parse to get the **fileKey**: the first path segment after `/design/` (e.g. from `.../design/yvoTWRBHHMvvVdTphS2UpN/...` → `yvoTWRBHHMvvVdTphS2UpN`). Ignore any `branch/...` segment when extracting the key.

Read `inputs/build-figma-variables-plan.md` in full to understand what changes are needed.

---

## Step 2 — Determine branch name

Analyze the plan to classify the type of change, then construct the branch name:

| Plan content | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Additions only | `[componentName]: Add` | `Tag: Add` |
| Additions of a specific variant | `[componentName]: Add - [variant description]` | `Tag: Add - Icon on right variant` |
| Deletions only | `[componentName]: Remove` | `Tag: Remove` |
| Deletion of a specific variant | `[componentName]: Remove - [variant description]` | `Radio button: Remove - Error variants` |
| Updates or mixed changes | `[componentName]: Update - [brief description]` | `Row: Update - Refactor with new CS tokens` |

Use `componentName` from `inputs/inputs.json` as `[componentName]`. For Update branches, derive a short description (≤ 5 words) from the plan's stated purpose or the nature of the changes.

---

## Step 3 — Create the Figma branch

If the Figma MCP server is available:

1. Use the Figma MCP branch creation tool with:
   - **fileKey**: parsed from `libraryUrl` in Step 1
   - **branchName**: determined in Step 2

2. Record the **branch file key** returned by the MCP — all subsequent MCP calls must use this branch file key, not the original file key.

If the Figma MCP server is not available, stop and inform the user that it must be configured to run this skill.

---

## Step 4 — Implement changes from the plan

The plan follows the output structure from the `figma-token-update-plan` skill. It contains up to five tasks. Read each task and execute as described below. Work through tasks in this order: **Task 2 renames → Task 1 & 2 updates → Task 3 deletes → Task 4 additions**. Skip Task 5 (in sync — no action needed).

Using the **branch file key** for all Figma MCP calls.

---

### Task 1 — Normalized exact matches (value updates only)

The plan has a table with columns: `CSV name | Figma name | Figma ID | Mode | Current value | Required value | Required value ID`.

For each row, use the Figma MCP update tool to set the variable's value for the specified **Mode** (Light Mode / Dark Mode / All Modes):
- Target variable: **Figma ID**
- New value: **Required value ID** (variable alias)

Multiple rows may reference the same variable (one row per mode that needs updating). Group updates to the same variable together.

---

### Task 2 — Potential matches (rename and/or value update)

The plan has one block per match in this format:

```
**CSV token:** `affirm.color...`
**Figma variable:** `color/...` (`VariableID:...`)
**Confidence:** High / Medium / Low — rationale
**Planned actions:**
- RENAME: `old/name` → `new/name`
- UPDATE Light Mode: `old value` → `new value` (`VariableID:...`)
- UPDATE Dark Mode: `old value` → `new value` (`VariableID:...`)
```

For each block:
1. **RENAME** (if present): use the Figma MCP update tool to rename the variable to the path after `→`. Use the Figma variable ID from **Figma variable** line.
2. **UPDATE** (if present): for each UPDATE line, set the variable's value for that mode to the variable alias ID in parentheses at the end of the line.

Skip Low-confidence blocks and note them as skipped in the summary.

If a planned action line reads `No value update needed`, skip the update step for that block.

---

### Task 3 — Deletes

The plan has a table with columns: `Figma variable name | Figma ID | Action`.

For each row with `Action = DELETE`, use the Figma MCP delete tool with the **Figma ID**.

---

### Task 4 — Additions

The plan has a table with columns: `CSV token name | All Modes | All Modes ID | Light Mode | Light Mode ID | Dark Mode | Dark Mode ID | Action`.

For each row with `Action = ADD`:

1. **Convert the CSV token name to a Figma variable name**: strip the leading `affirm.` prefix, then replace all `.` separators with `/`.
   - Example: `affirm.color.top_nav_bar.main.static.container.bg` → `color/top_nav_bar/main/static/container/bg`

2. **Infer the collection** from the first path segment of the converted name:
   - `color/...` → color collection
   - `spacing/...` → spacing collection
   - `size/...` → size collection
   - `radius/...` → radius collection
   - `position/...` → position collection
   - `shadow/...` → color collection

3. Use the Figma MCP `post_variables` tool (or equivalent create tool) to create the variable with:
   - **name**: converted Figma variable name
   - Values per mode: use **All Modes ID** if the All Modes columns are populated; otherwise use **Light Mode ID** and **Dark Mode ID** as variable alias IDs for their respective modes. Empty cells mean that mode has no value — do not set it.

---

If any step fails, note the failure and continue with remaining changes.

---

## Step 5 — Write summary

After completing all changes, write a summary to:

`outputs/2-build-figma-variables/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-{componentName}-build-summary.md`

Sanitize `componentName` for filenames (lowercase, spaces/slashes → hyphens; use `component` as fallback). Use today's date and time for `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM`.

```markdown
# Figma Variables Build Summary — {componentName}

**Generated:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Library:** {libraryUrl}
**Branch:** {branchName}
**Branch file key:** {branchFileKey}

---

## Summary

| Action | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Variables added | N |
| Variables updated | N |
| Variables renamed | N |
| Variables deleted | N |

---

## Changes applied

### Additions
- `variable/name` — Collection: X, Type: Y, All Modes: Z

### Updates
- `variable/name` (`VariableID:...`) — Mode: old value → new value

### Renames
- `old/name` → `new/name` (`VariableID:...`)

### Deletions
- `variable/name` (`VariableID:...`)

---

## Failures

<!-- List any steps that could not be completed, with the error or reason. If none, write "None." -->

---

## Next steps

The branch **{branchName}** is ready for the designer to build the component using these variables.
```

Do not modify any files in `inputs/`. Write only the summary file described above.
