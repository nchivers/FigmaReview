# QA Storybook

Check out a pull request branch in the **ux** monorepo, perform a clean Storybook build, start the dev server, and launch the app on the user's chosen mobile platform.

---

## Inputs

Read **inputs/inputs.json** (paths relative to workspace root):

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `pullRequestUrl` | **Required.** Full URL to the GitHub pull request (e.g. `https://github.com/Affirm/ux/pull/42`). Used to resolve the PR head branch to check out. |

---

## Workflow

### 1. Navigate to the ux repo

All build and run commands execute in the **ux** repo located at `../ux` relative to this workspace root.

- Verify `../ux` exists and contains a `.git` directory.
- If it does not exist, **stop** and tell the user to run the `ds-toolbox-setup-mobile` command first to clone the repo.
- Use `../ux` as the working directory for all subsequent shell commands in this skill.

### 2. Resolve the PR branch

Parse `pullRequestUrl` to extract **owner**, **repo**, and **PR number** (format: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}`).

Run:

```
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json headRefName -q .headRefName
```

This returns the branch name for the PR head (e.g. `feature/my-component`).

### 3. Fetch and checkout the branch

Run these commands sequentially in `../ux`:

```
git fetch origin <branch>
git checkout <branch>
git pull origin <branch>
```

This ensures the local copy is fully up to date with the remote PR head.

### 4. Clean dev build

Run the following as a single chained command in `../ux`:

```
pnpm i && pnpm --filter storybook prebuild:clean && pnpm --filter storybook dev
```

This command:
1. Installs all monorepo dependencies.
2. Runs a clean prebuild for the storybook package (generates native project files fresh).
3. Starts the Storybook Expo dev server.

The dev server is **long-running**. Start it with `block_until_ms: 0` (immediately background it), then monitor the terminal output for a line indicating the bundler is ready (e.g. a prompt showing available commands like `i` for iOS, `a` for Android, or a "Bundler ready" / "Metro waiting" message).

### 5. Ask the user which platform to launch

Once the dev server output confirms it is ready, use the **AskQuestion** tool to ask:

> Which platform would you like to open Storybook on?
> - iOS Simulator
> - Android Emulator

### 6. Launch on device

Based on the user's choice, send the corresponding keystroke to the running dev server terminal:

- **iOS Simulator:** send `i`
- **Android Emulator:** send `a`

The dev server will trigger the native build and open the app on the selected platform.

## Notes

- This skill does **not** produce an output file. It is a "run and interact" skill.
- The dev server remains running after launch. The user can stop it manually or the agent can kill the process when done.
- If the build fails, inspect the terminal output for errors and report them to the user.
